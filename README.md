**Week 1**

**Unit 1 - Introduction to HTML &amp; CSS**

Html is used to build websites and other web related softwares. We use the internet as a meeting point between computers and humans.
We use three programming languages to develop websites, namely HTML, CSS and Javascript.
HTML - Hypertext Markup Language is used to mark the content of the website. It is also known as a declarative language because the code is simple and declares the instructions.
It  can handle incorrect code and try to fix it and delive functinal results.

CSS - Cascading Style Sheets is used to stle the website and make it more appealing and user friendly, using fonts, colours and resizing.

Javascript is a programming language used to create interactive and complex websites. It is more powerfull than HTML and CSS but it's delicate. If there are errors in the code or th browser cannot understand
the code it will crash. When you write code you need to make sure that it will run outdated browsers and also run on multiple platforms like Windows, Mac, Linux, Android
1. Web programming is broken into three parts for it to remain resilient to changes in technology.
2. JavaScript is the most powerful ab resilient out of all the three.
3. When HTMl is broken or there is  bg in the code. the web browser will guess what it wants and try to fix the code and display something.

**Unit 2 - Text Formatting**

Html uses tags(which  use less than and greater than symbols) to structure web pages, most tags come in pairs an opening and a closing tag - together they are called an element.
Nested element - an element inside another one
DOM - Document Object Model is a structure/tree that shows how nested elements are related.
HTML headlines range from 1 to 6, 1 being the biggest going down in size. They are used as  hierachy to show what is important and what will grab the users attention
HTML Bold & Italics - the formatting styles are used to put emphsis on a word or phrase. We use <i> for visual italics and <em> to add emphasis. 
We also use <b> to make texts bold and <strong> to emphasize

HTML Integration

Involves using HTML code in different contexts to create content, structure, and functionality in websites. It's a combinatin of HTML, CSS and Javascript
An HTML page is a document written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) that defines the structure and content of a webpage.
After the HTML file is created, every web page requires a few essential components. 
First, a doctype statement indicating the HTML file's era should appear at the beginning of the file. 
The remaining content on the page is then contained within an HTML element, also referred to as an HTML element. It informs us that every piece of content inside is HTML. 
Within the HTML element, there are two primary sections for organizing content: the head and the body. The head encompasses all the metadata essential for the browser but remains invisible on the actual page. In contrast, the body is the area where the majority of the visible content and interactions take place.
The document head contains metadata and other information about the document, such as the title, character encoding, and links to external resources.
Content structuring involves organizing elements within a webpage to create a logical hierarchy and layout. It includes using semantic elements like <main>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, and <aside> to define different parts of the document, providing meaning and context to the content.
