Introduction to HTML &amp; CSS
Html is used to build websites and other web related softwares. We use the internet as a meeting point between computers and humans.
We use three programming languages to develop websites, namely HTML, CSS and Javascript.
HTML - Hypertext Markup Language is used to mark the content of the website. It is also known as a declarative language because the code is simple and declares the instructions.
It  can handle incorrect code and try to fix it and delive functinal results.
CSS - Cascading Style Sheets is used to stle the website and makeit more appealing and user friendly, using fonts, colours and resizing.
Javascript is a programming language used to create interactive and complex websites. It is more powerfull than HTML and CSS but it's delicate. If there are errors in the code or th browser cannot understand
the code it will crash. When you write code you need to make sure that it will run outdated browsers and also run on multiple platforms.
